## Installation
_Download code from the `master` branch. Code in the `development` branch is often incomplete and
nonfunctional._

1. Run `python3 bot.py` from the source directory.
2. Configure the bot when prompted. If you already have already configured the bot, you can use
that configuration or create a new one.
3. Once the bot has successfully connected, command the bot via IRC. There are also a number of
admin commands available only to bot operators. These are outlined in the [documentation]
(http://molly.github.io/GorillaBot/).
