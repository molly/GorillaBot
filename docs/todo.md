# To do

##Bugs
* ~~Flirt and regex commands break everything~~
* If something goes wrong, the bot drops off the network

##General
* Reconnect after the bot is disconnected from the server or the socket is closed
  * Failsafe/limit so that if something goes wrong, the bot doesn't repeatedly disconnect and reconnect
* ~~Kill switch in case something does go wrong with the bot~~
* ~~Allow some modules to be loaded on request~~
  * Learn new commands?
* Gracefully exit on `KeyboardInterrupt`
* `VERSION` reply
* Check security
* ~~Join channels after identifying to NickServ (to avoid issues with invite-only channels that depend on the cloak)~~
* ~~Send initialize commands as a response to 004, not immediately~~
* ~~Hook commands?~~
* Add API section to config file
* ~~Move string lists, etc. to a data file~~
* ~~Modularize commands~~
* ~~Throttle some commands (!help, !command, etc.)~~
* ~~Only show !help and !command-type commands if they're at the beginning of the sentence~~
* Allow part and quit commands to display a message as well
* Allow command aliases
* ~~Allow bot admins to be added and removed while the bot is live~~
    * ~~Store in config file?~~
* ~~Add regex matching to trigger commands (be sure to throttle)~~
* ~~Don't hardcode bot admins~~
* ~~Determine bot op based on ident, not nick~~
* ~~Allow channel ops to perform bot admin commands~~
* Write tests
