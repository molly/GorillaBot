Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. 
Drive sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale... who knows, Master Wayne? You start pretending to have fun, you might even have a little by accident. 
Why do we fall, sir? So that we might learn to pick ourselves up. 
Any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with. 
Know your limits, Master Wayne. 
You can tell me the Russian for "Apply your own bloody suntan lotion." 
Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town? 
I never fail to marvel at your narrow escapes, sir.
We're going to need a bigger cave. 
Rough night of crimefighting, sir?
